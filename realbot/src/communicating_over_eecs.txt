1) Put both computers hostnames and ip addresses in each others etc/hosts file. 
    get the wifi ip address with ifconfig (might have to download iftools first)
    get the hostname with $hostname
2) Launch the roscore on the host machine (and whatever else)
3) Set the remote master URI to the wifi ip address of the host machine.
    $export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://{the wifi ip address}:11311
